It displays menu of 4 option, which is the menu option for user to chose. The application starts with options to add, update, delete and read the data.


**Details of the project:**

In this project, i have used SQL language to create tables, add data and alter the data with the help of Oracle sql developer tool. Moreover, i have connected it with the command prompt by using C++ programming language with the help of Oracle environment library.

Furthermore, Creation Script, Data Script and PL/SQL Script have been shared separately.

While creating tables, to reduce redundancy and dependency, i have implmented Normalization technique for relational database. Apart from this, i have used an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) as a visual representation of the structure of a database.
